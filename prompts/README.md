# Prompt Library

This folder contains **optional prompt templates** designed to accelerate agent interactions with this repository.

## Purpose

These prompts exist to:
- Reduce hallucination
- Reduce token usage
- Standardize intent

## Important Note

**Governance still lives in AGENT_RULES.md and related instruction files.** These prompts are accelerators, not replacements. They reference governance files; they do not restate them verbosely.

## Usage

Copy and paste the appropriate prompt template into your Agentic AI tool, then customize as needed for your specific task.

## Available Prompts

- `start.md` - Universal entry prompt for any Agentic AI tool
- `small-feature.md` - Single component or tightly scoped UI features
- `medium-feature.md` - Multi-component or single-page features
- `large-feature.md` - Complex or multi-page features
